                    <h3>What is Chorioactis?</h3>
                    <p>Chorioactis is a genus of fungi that contains the single species Chorioactis geaster. The
                        mushroom is commonly known as the devil's cigar or the Texas star in the United States, while in
                        Japan it is called kirinomitake (キリノミタケ). This extremely rare mushroom is notable for its
                        unusual appearance and disjunct distribution; it is found only in select locales in Texas and
                        Japan. The fruit body, which grows on the stumps or dead roots of cedar elms (in Texas) or dead
                        oaks (in Japan), somewhat resembles a dark brown or black cigar before it splits open radially
                        into a starlike arrangement of four to seven leathery rays. The interior surface of the fruit
                        body bears the spore-bearing tissue known as the hymenium, and is colored white to brown,
                        depending on its age. The fruit body opening can be accompanied by a distinct hissing sound and
                        the release of a smoky cloud of spores. </p>

                    <h3>Chorioactis History</h3>
                    <p>The fungus was first collected in 1893 by botanist Lucien Marcus Underwood, who sent the
                        specimens to mycologist Charles Horton Peck for identification. Peck described the species as
                        Urnula geaster in that year's Annual Report of the New York State Botanist, although he
                        expressed doubt about its generic placement in Urnula. In 1902, student mycologist Elsie
                        Kupfer questioned the proposed classification of various species in the genera Urnula and
                        Geopyxis, as suggested in an 1896 publication on the Discomycetes by German mycologist Heinrich
                        Rehm. Working with Underwood's guidance, Kupfer compared the microscopic structure of the
                        hymenium (the fertile, spore-bearing tissue) of the Texan species with a number of similar
                        ones—Geopyxis carbonaria, Urnula craterium, and Urnula terrestris (now known as Podophacidium
                        xanthomelum). She concluded that the Texan species was so dissimilar as to warrant its own
                        genus, which she named Chorioactis. Although this taxonomical change was opposed in later
                        studies of the fungus by Frederick De Forest Heald and Frederick Adolf Wolf (1910) and Fred
                        Jay Seaver (1928, 1942), Chorioactis was established as a valid genus in 1968 by Finn-Egil
                        Eckblad in his comprehensive monograph about the Discomycetes.</p>

                    <h3>Mysterious Mushroom</h3>
                    <p>Scientists do not know why the fungus mysteriously lives only in Texas and Japan, locations of
                        approximately the same latitude, but separated by 11,000 km (6,800 mi). Fred Jay Seaver
                        commented "this is only another illustration of the unusual and unpredictable distribution of
                        many species of the fungi. It would be difficult indeed to account for it, and we merely accept
                        the facts as they are." In 2004, a research study compared the DNA sequences of both
                        populations and used a combination of molecular phylogenetics and molecular clock calculations
                        to estimate the extent of genetic divergence. It concluded that the two populations have been
                        separated for at least 19 million years, ruling out the possibility of human introduction of the
                        species from one location to the other. Although no consistent differences in morphology are
                        seen between the two populations, several differences exist in their life histories. The
                        preferred host of Texan populations is typically roots and stumps of Ulmus crassifolia, while
                        the Japanese populations tend to grow on the fallen trunks of Symplocos myrtacea and Quercus
                        gilva. Texan species grow in areas subjected to periodic flooding, unlike their Japanese
                        counterparts. Finally, only Japanese specimens can be grown in culture—the spores of Texan
                        material have not been successfully germinated on artificial media.</p>

            <h2>Fun Fact!</h2>
            <p>The largest organism in the world (by area) is a fungus. The fungus has survived for over 2,400 years, surviving on living and dead wood. Mushrooms (fruiting bodies) make up only a tiny part of the fungus, with the rest living underground as networks of threads (hyphae) that make up the mycelium.</p>
