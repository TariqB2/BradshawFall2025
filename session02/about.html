        <h2>About Cortinarius violaceus</h2>
        <p>Cortinarius violaceus, commonly known as the violet webcap or violet cort, is a fungus in the webcap genus, Cortinarius, for which it serves as the type species. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 and has undergone several name changes. It is readily distinguished from other species in the genus by its dark colouration and distinct cystidia. There are some populations that seem to prefer deciduous trees and others that prefer pines, but no genetic divergence between the two has been found. When identified as taxonomically separate from the deciduous-preferring populations, the pine-preferring populations have been referred to either as a separate species, C. hercynicus, or as a subspecies, C. violaceus ssp. hercynicus. Other populations once identified as C. violaceus or close to that species have now been described as new and separate species, such as C. palatinus, C. neotropicus, C. altissimus, C. kioloensis and C. hallowellensis.<p>
         <h3>Taxonomy</h3>
        <p>Kingdom: <br> Fungi</p>
        <p>Division:<br> Basidiomycota</p>
        <blockquote>Basidiomycota are filamentous fungi composed of hyphae (except for basidiomycota-yeast) and reproduce sexually via the formation of specialized club-shaped end cells called basidia that normally bear external meiospores (usually four). These specialized spores are called basidiospores.[5] However, some Basidiomycota are obligate asexual reproducers. Basidiomycota that reproduce asexually (discussed below) can typically be recognized as members of this division by gross similarity to others, by the formation of a distinctive anatomical feature (the clamp connection), cell wall components, and definitively by phylogenetic molecular analysis of DNA sequence data.</blockquote>
        <p>Class:<br> Agaricomycetes</p>
        <blockquote>Although morphology of the mushroom or fruit body (basidiocarp) was the basis of early classification of the Agaricomycetes,[8] this is no longer the case. As an example, the distinction between the Gasteromycetes (including puffballs) and Agaricomycetes (most other agaric mushrooms) is no longer recognized as a natural oneâ€”various puffball species have apparently evolved independently from agaricomycete fungi. However, most mushroom guide books still group the puffballs or gasteroid forms separate from other mushrooms because the older Friesian classification is still convenient for categorizing fruit body forms. Similarly, modern classifications divide the gasteroid order Lycoperdales between Agaricales and Phallales.</blockquote>
        <p>Order:<br> Agaricales</p>
        <blockquote>The Agaricales are an order of fungi in the division Basidiomycota. As originally conceived, the order contained all the agarics (gilled mushrooms), but subsequent research has shown that not all agarics are closely related and some belong in other orders, such as the Russulales and Boletales. Conversely, DNA research has also shown that many non-agarics, including some of the clavarioid fungi (clubs and corals) and gasteroid fungi (puffballs and false truffles) belong within the Agaricales. The order has 46 extant families, more than 400 genera, and over 25,000 described species,[4] along with six extinct genera known only from the fossil record.[5][6][1] Species in the Agaricales range from the familiar Agaricus bisporus (cultivated mushroom) and the deadly Amanita virosa (destroying angel) to the coral-like Clavaria zollingeri (violet coral) and bracket-like Fistulina hepatica (beefsteak fungus).</blockquote>
        <p>Family:<br> Cortinariaceae</p>
        <blockquote>The Cortinariaceae are a large family of gilled mushrooms found worldwide, containing over 3200 species.[3] The family takes its name from its largest genus, the varied species of the genus Cortinarius. Many genera formerly in the Cortinariaceae have been placed in various other families, including Hymenogastraceae, Inocybaceae and Bolbitiaceae.</blockquote>
