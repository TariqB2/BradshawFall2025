        <h2>Let's explore Purple Mushroom</h2>
        <p>Cortinarius violaceus, commonly known as the violet webcap or violet cort, is a fungus in the webcap genus, Cortinarius, for which it serves as the type species. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753 and has undergone several name changes. It is readily distinguished from other species in the genus by its dark colouration and distinct cystidia. There are some populations that seem to prefer deciduous trees and others that prefer pines, but no genetic divergence between the two has been found. When identified as taxonomically separate from the deciduous-preferring populations, the pine-preferring populations have been referred to either as a separate species, C. hercynicus, or as a subspecies, C. violaceus ssp. hercynicus. Other populations once identified as C. violaceus or close to that species have now been described as new and separate species, such as C. palatinus, C. neotropicus, C. altissimus, C. kioloensis and C. hallowellensis.</p>
        <blockquote> "The sudden appearance of mushrooms after a summer rain is one of the more impressive spectacles of
            the plant world.""
